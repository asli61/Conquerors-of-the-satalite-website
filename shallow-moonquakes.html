                    <h2>Shallow Moonquakes</h2>
                    
                    <br>
                    <P>Shallow moonquakes with focal depths of less than 200 km are rare events, making up less than 1% of all identified events. They are significantly larger than the deep moonquakes (Mw of up to 4.7), have a low b value (Nakamura, 1977), and are sometimes also associated with exceptionally large stress drops (Oberst, 1987). As tectonic quakes on a stagnant-lid planet, they might be comparable to intraplate earthquakes, which exhibit some similar properties (Nakamura et al., 1982). (Science Direct)

                        <br><br>The shallow lunar quakes are even more enigmatic. Compared to the deep moonquakes, they are relatively rare; during almost 8 years of continuous data collection, only 28 such events were recorded and their epicenters were not correlated with known geologic or geographic features. One interpretation is that these moonquakes were formed by the release of thermoelastic stresses in the lunar crust or the upper mantle, possibly connected to large impact basins.

                    <P>The dozens of shallow moonquakes are possibly formed by impact cratering and tectonic activity. The widespread small and fresh-appearing tectonic features on the Moon are believed to be young and possibly active  In theory, moonquakes generated by the activity of these small structures can be on the same magnitude with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (Nahm and Velasco, 2013). Elastic waves have a much slower decaying rate on the Moon due to the lack of pore water, the Copernican-aged tectonic features could theoretically release a large amount of stored energy over the entire Moon. Recently, by relocating the possible epicenter for a shallow moonquake recorded by the Apollo seismometers, the possible triggering fault, which is located beneath young compressional structures is revealed (Watters et al., 2019; Senthil Kumar et al., 2019). Interestingly, clusters of rock falls are observed near the lobate scarp, and the falls were interpreted to be caused by the recent fault movement (Senthil Kumar et al., 2019).
