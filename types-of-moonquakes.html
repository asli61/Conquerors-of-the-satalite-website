                    <p> A moonquake is one kind of vibration on the surface of the moon.
                         On<br> July 20, 1969 human first touched the moon’s surface.
                         Neil Amstrong<br> and Buzz Aldrin were the first astronauts 
                         whose set a seismometer in<br> moon surface and observed quake 
                         there. Apollo 11 was the name of<br> their space flight .(WSN ,2018)

                    <p>The moon is still tectonically active.<br><br>
                        The findings come as a surprise because, throughout our solar system, 
                        there is only one body known to be tectonically active, and that's Earth.<br><br>
                        Initially, the scarps were believed to have been created when the moon 
                        cooled and shrunk billions of years ago.<br><br>
                        But more tools would be deployed to unravel these mysterious formations. 
                        Not only did the Apollo missions have cameras, but missions 12, 14, 15 
                        and 16 landing sites were equipped with seismometers measuring ground 
                        shaking, or moonquakes. It was thought that these could be behind the 
                        formation of the scarps.(CBC News , 2019)

                    <h2>The 4 Types of Moonquakes</h2>      
                    <h4>Deep moonquakes</h4>
                    <p>Deep moonquakes happen extremely often, typically on a cycle of roughly 
                        27 days, and occur nearly 700 km below the surface of the moon These 
                        moonquakes clearly display tidal periodicities in their histories of 
                        origin times and signal amplitudes; they are presumably triggered by 
                        the solid-body tide in the moon, raised primarily by the earth.( 
                        Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors, 1979) The moon 
                        may cause the   tides of our oceans to move, but the Earth also acts 
                        on the  moon in even more dramatic ways, literally</p>

                    <h4>Meteor Impacts</h4>
                    <p>Meteor impacts can also cause moonquakes, and since there is no 
                        atmosphere on the moon, every small meteorite that is headed for 
                        the moon will strike it, rather than burning up in the atmosphere, 
                        as they do on Earth. These impacts cause rippling earthquakes that 
                        can be detected by those seismometerscracking the deep rocky core 
                        of the moon!</p>

                    <p> When the sunlight returns after the two-week lunar night then the 
                        frigid lunar crust expands and at the consequences, quake has 
                        happened. This quake is termed as thermal moonquakes.  Thermal 
                        moonquake activity starts abruptly, about 2 days after lunar 
                        sunrise and decreases rapidly after sunset.( Journal of Geophysical 
                        Research ,1974) This temperature difference is recorded as 400 degrees 
                        Fahrenheit.(WSN , 2018) (NASA , 2019)</p>

                    <h4>Shallow Moonquakes</h4>
                    <p> Shallow moonquakes are the most powerful and the most worrisome for researchers 
                        and those eager to colonize the moon. Of the four types of 
                        quakes, these are the ones that could do some real damage. 
                        The exact cause of these shallow quakes is unknown, but analysis 
                        gives the first evidence that these faults are still active and 
                        likely producing moonquakes today as the Moon continues to gradually 
                        cool and shrink some of these quakes can be fairly strong, around five 
                        on the Richter scale(NASA , 2019). Furthermore, shallow moonquakes 
                        lasted a remarkably long time. Once they got going, all continued 
                        more than 10 minutes. "The moon was ringing like a bell," Neal says.
