                    <h2>What Is Moonquakes ?</h2>
                    
                    <br>
                    <P>A moonquake is the lunar equivalent of an earthquake (i.e., a quake on the Moon)
                        although moonquakes are caused in different ways. They were first discovered 
                        by the Apollo astronauts. The largest moonquakes are much weaker than the 
                        largest earthquakes, though their shaking can last for up to an hour, due to 
                        fewer attenuating (weakening) factors to damp seismic vibrations. We know about 
                        these moonquakes with the information that comes from the seismometers placed on 
                        the moon by the Apollo missions. The instruments were placed by the Apollo 11, 
                        12, 14, 15 and 16 missions from 1969 through 1972 and all of these instruments 
                        except the one placed by Apollo 11 -which only worked for three weeks- functioned 
                        perfectly until they were switched off in 1977.
                        <br><br>There are four kinds of moonquakes:
                        Deep moonquakes,Meteorite impacts, Thermal moonquakes, Shallow moonquakes</P>
                        <br>
